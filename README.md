# ShardingJdbcDemo

How to run?
---
1. Install mysql on localhost (version 8.0.22)
2. Execute the initial.sql after connected to mysql
3. Run OrderMapperTest

I tried a couple of times for ShardingSphere's official demo and they are all failed. After I figured it out I decided to make a simple demo for sharding databases and sharding tables,
if you could understand the basics, you could easily scale you project with official references. Hope this repo could help you.

There's a my blog for this demo, check it out: [Using ShardingJDBC to shard databases and tables](https://juejin.cn/post/6914548506678001672)
